How to make a new item:

    1. Make a new static final RegistryObject in ModItems.

    2. Make a call to builder in registerModels in ModItemModelProvider. Use the same itemGenerated.

    3. Add the item texture to src/main/resources/assets/teggunekcihc/textures/item. Be sure to name the file appropriately.

    4. Update src/main/resources/assets/teggunekcihc/lang/en_us.json. Please keep groupings nice and put the item by the other items.

    5. Make required calls to tag in addTags in ModItemTagsProvider.

    6. runData, then runClient to make sure the item is in the game.
